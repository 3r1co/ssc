# Static Code Analysis with Sonar (1 hour)

The first thing you need to scan in your application is your actual source code.

One very famous tool to do so is **Sonarqube**. There is already a Github Action available for this tool [here](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarcloud-github-action
).

For this tutorial, you need to create an account on https://sonarcloud.io.

In this exercise, integrate this action into your Github workflow and do the validation before you actually deploy resources in AWS. Also, fix all issues that are reported through the scanner.
